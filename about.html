        <h2>Corn Dog</h2>
        <p>Hey, I'm a games programmer. I'm currently doing the Online 
            Game Development Foundations course at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment. 
            I haven't released any games yet but I hope to someday. 
            I have worked on quite a few small projects (mostly 2D),
            I am currently developing 'Blast: Asteroids' and soon
            will begin working on 'Party Mayhem' (working title) with a partner.</p>
