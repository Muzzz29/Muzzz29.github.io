                    <p>I am a 16 year old student programmer. I am currently studying
                        year 10 (2018). I have wanted to be in the games industry
                        since I was 8 years old and I have been trying to learn
                        programming and scripting since I was 13. I started 2 Cert III
                        courses with The AIE at the beginning of 2018, one of which I
                        will finish at the end of 2018 and the other at the end of 2019.
