                        I am currently on my way to getting a <b>Certificate III</b>
                        in <b>Information, Digital Media and Technology ICT30115</b>.
                        If everything goes to plan then I will be finished the course
                        on the 4th of October 2018 and recieve my <b>Cert III</b> soon after.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because of this course I am now capable of using Unity,
                        C#, HTML and CSS. I have also been given a much wider
                        understanding of the games industry and the process of
                        game Development. I was given the chance to work as part
                        of a group in a team project and that was an amazing
                        opportunity, both for the software I learnt to use as well
                        as the team communication skills.
