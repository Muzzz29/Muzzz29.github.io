                        Blast: Asteroids is a 2D Bullet Hell game where you start
                        with no movement at all but as you progress you gain more
                        control over your ship.

                        This is a game I was working on before learning how to use
                        Unity and C#. I used Game Maker Studio but didn't get super
                        far with it.
